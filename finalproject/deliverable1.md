## Concepts I don't understand

### **Apache**
   * **Definition**: a free, open-source web server that's a key component of the internet and is often used on Linux operating systems
### **Web ports**
   * **Definition**: a virtual gateway on a server, identified by a unique number, that allows incoming network traffic specifically for web services, like displaying web pages
### **Firewall**
   * **Definition**: a software-based security system built into the Linux operating system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic
### **`ufw`**
   * **Definition**: "Uncomplicated Firewall," which is a user-friendly command-line tool used to manage firewall rules on a system
### **`systemctl`**
   * **Definition**: a command-line tool in Linux that manages and monitors the systemd system and service manager
### **`systemd`** 
   * **Definition**:  a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems
### **Init system**
   * **Definition**: the first process started during booting of the operating system
### **`chown`**
   * **Definition**: stands for "change owner" and is a command used to modify the user who owns a specific file or directory

## What are some different web server applications?
Some web application frameworks include simple HTTP servers
Examples:
  ### Apache
  ![Apache](https://www.apache.org/logos/res/httpd/default.png)
   * Apache is a free and open-source web server that delivers web content through the internet
  ### Nginx

   * A web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache
  ### Lighttpd
  ![Lighttpd](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Lighttpd_logo.svg/1200px-Lighttpd_logo.svg.png)
   * A secure, fast, compliant, and very flexible web-server that has been optimized for high-performance environments

## What is a web server? Hardware and software side
The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.
#### Hardware Side
  * On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files)
#### Software side
  * On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server.

## What is virtualization?
The technology that allows a single physical computer to act like multiple separate computers by dividing its hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage) into isolated virtual environments

## What is virtualbox?
A free, open-source virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single device

## What is a virtual machine?
A software-based computer that acts like a physical computer, but uses virtual resources instead of physical components

## What is Ubuntu Server?
A specialized version of the Ubuntu operating system designed specifically for running server applications and services, like web hosting, file sharing, databases, and enterprise-level applications

## What is a firewall?
A network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic

## What is SSH?
Stands for "Secure Shell," which is a network protocol that allows users to securely access and manage remote computers over an unsecured network, like the internet, by encrypting the communication between devices, enabling secure logins and command execution on those systems
